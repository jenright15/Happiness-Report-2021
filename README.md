# Happiness-Report-2021

This project explores the happiness report 2021 dataset from kaggle. 
The objective is to derive key insights from the data into what makes people happy.



# Methods
Exploratory data analysis is done through creating an interactive dashboard in Tableau.
- The dashboard shows us that there is a linear relationship between ladder score and most of the features.
- The relationships are explored further in regression models.
